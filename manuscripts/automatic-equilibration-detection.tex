\begin{abstract}
Molecular simulations (molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo) are often initiated from configurations that are highly dissimilar to equilibrium samples, a practice which causes the appearance of a distinct initial transient in various mechanical observables computed over the timecourse of the simulation.
Traditional practice in simulation data analysis recommends this initial transient portion be discarded as \emph{equilibration}, but no simple, general automated procedure exists.
Here, we consider a simple, automated, easy-to-implement procedure in which the final region of the simulation that maximizes the number of effectively uncorrelated samples is used.
We present a reference implementation of this procedure and illustrate its application to synthetic and real data.

\label{section:introduction}

% Molecular simulations generate correlated timeseries data; we can think of this as a realization of an MCMC chain
% Often, we want to compute an average (expectation) of some property A(x)
% Standard practice is to discard the initial transient to "equilibration" (a process known in the MCMC literature as "burn-in")
% In principle, if we run the chain long enough, it will converge to the true mean; no discarding is required (Gelman)
% In practice, however, starting from highly atypical initial conditions may mean that we need to run for a very long time
% Often, we're limited in how much data we can collect, so we are faced with the problem of how to make the best of the data we were able to collect

% Other schemes for determining the equilibrated region exist
% Some are based on statistical hypothesis tests, and assume the data follow a Gaussian form (Wei Yang, Karplus)

% We propose a simple approach: Select the origin of the equilibrated (production) region $t_0$ that maximizes the number of effectively uncorrelated samples

% Aside on computing the effective number of correlated samples and statistical error
